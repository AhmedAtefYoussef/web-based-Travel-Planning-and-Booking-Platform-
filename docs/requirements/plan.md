## Travel Platform — Milestone 1 Engineering
## Plan & Team Workflow
Nov 2, 2026 ·  @Ahmed
## Summary
Milestone 1 (deadline Fri 20 Nov, 18 days from today) is a complete NestJS + MongoDB
Atlas backend of 108 mandatory endpoints (the brief's API tables, optional rows
excluded), evaluated entirely through Swagger UI. The repository is currently empty (no
commits), so the first three days go to a shared foundation that unblocks all seven people
at once.
How the work is split: each member owns one vertical domain end to end (schema,
service, controller, DTOs, Swagger docs, tests). Ahmed owns the foundation, the shared
cross-cutting services, payments, pull-request reviews and releases. Ownership follows
the feature modules the brief names, which keeps merge conflicts low and makes Git
history show clear individual contributions.
Five decisions that shape everything else:
- Short-lived access JWT + refresh token, both in httpOnly, Secure, SameSite cookies
## (ACC-19). A
sessions
collection stores the hashed refresh token and
lastActivityAt
, so logout revokes it and 30 minutes without a request ends the
session (ACC-06). Swagger UI is same-origin, so after
## /api/auth/login
every later
call is authenticated automatically.
- Deny-by-default authorization: a global auth guard, a
@Public()
decorator, a
@Roles()
guard, a provider-scope guard for moderators, and ownership checks inside
services (ACC-11, GEN-13).
- Inventory safety through atomic conditional updates (flight cabins) and a unique
(roomId, date)
index (hotel rooms), never read-then-write. Holds last exactly 10
minutes (FLT-22, HTL-18).
- One booking lifecycle for both types: Pending Payment → Confirmed → Completed,
plus Pending Payment → Expired and Confirmed → Cancelled (GEN-11). Confirmation
only happens after the Stripe webhook verifies the PaymentIntent; the cancellation
tiers are snapshotted onto the booking when policies are accepted.

- Booking money uses one platform currency in integer minor units (PAY-04). Only
itinerary budgets are multi-currency, converted with daily-cached FXRatesAPI rates.
All datetimes are stored in UTC and shown in each airport's local time zone (GEN-06).
Inputs received (2 Nov): the reviewed requirements workbook (104 mandatory rows, 11
bonus rows) and the mock reference data (8 countries, cities, airports and attractions).
The rules below quote the workbook directly. Where the workbook and the project
description disagree, the workbook wins, as the brief says.
SDLC approach
We run an iterative, incremental process (lightweight Scrum): one foundation sprint, two
build sprints and a hardening window, each ending in a merge to
develop
that someone
can demo in Swagger. All six classic SDLC phases still happen, but compressed and per
feature rather than once for the whole project.

Definition of Ready (before anyone starts an issue): requirement ID and acceptance
criteria copied from the workbook, schema fields agreed, and any dependency (guard,
service or seed data) is merged or stubbed.
Ceremonies kept light for a student team: a 10-minute async stand-up in the group chat
every day (yesterday / today / blocked), a 30-minute sprint review on 4, 11 and 17 Nov
where everyone demos in Swagger, and the Jira Scrum board (TRVL) with columns To Do
→ In Progress → Done, each issue linking its open pull request while in review.
Backend architecture and technical decisions
One NestJS app, layered as Controller (HTTP + DTO validation + Swagger) → Service
(business rules, ownership, transactions) → Mongoose Model. Controllers never touch
models directly, and modules talk to each other only through exported services.

the API fails, the last cached rates are

Data model
The rule we follow: embed bounded data the parent owns and always reads with it;
reference anything shared, independently changing, unbounded, or addressed by its own
top-level endpoint (e.g.
## /api/activities/:id
). Every collection gets
timestamps:
true
; every list filter and sort field gets an index.

searched in each airport's local time

Reference dataThe seed uses the dataset's own keys as
document ids (
cities._id = "cairo"

), so our records match the
identifiers used in evaluation; the
currency list comes from the countries'
currencies

Unique indexes do the heavy lifting: "like at most once" (BLG-06), "one review per
reservation" (HTL-23), "report an item at most once" (GEN-09) and "no overlapping room
bookings" are enforced by the database, so race conditions are impossible even if two
requests arrive at the same millisecond.
Team ownership matrix
Work is split into seven vertical domains of roughly equal effort (count of mandatory
endpoints, weighted by difficulty), with Ahmed carrying fewer endpoints to leave time for
reviewing every PR. Each owner is also the second reviewer for the neighbour listed in the
last column.

Payment and booking flow (the most coupled path)
- User searches (Joudy / Sandra), then
POST /api/flight-bookings
returns a priced
summary (Karim).
- Proceeding to payment:
POST /api/flight-bookings/hold
or
POST /api/hotel-
bookings
(Karim) reserves inventory atomically and creates the booking as Pending
Payment with
holdExpiresAt = now + 10 min
## .
## 3.
GET .../policies
, then
POST .../accept-policies
(Ahmed): tiers and baggage / check-
in rules snapshotted, acceptance timestamp stored. Payment is blocked until this is
done.
## 4.
POST /api/payments
(Ahmed) creates the PaymentIntent in the platform currency
and returns its
clientSecret
. In M2 the card goes into Stripe Elements; in the M1
Swagger demo we confirm it with the Stripe CLI or the Dashboard using a test card.
- Stripe calls
POST /api/payments/webhook
## . On
payment_intent.succeeded
## (signature
verified) →
markConfirmed
(Karim): held → booked, unique reference, notification, e-
ticket available. On failure the user may retry until the hold ends.
- If 10 minutes pass first, Karim's job sets the booking Expired, releases the seats or
room nights, and Ahmed cancels the PaymentIntent.
- Cancel (Karim): refund quote from the snapshot tiers → confirm → Cancelled,
inventory released →
refundFor
(Ahmed) → Stripe refund, status Pending → Refunded
/ Failed, notification.
- After departure or check-out the job marks the booking Completed, which unlocks
hotel reviews.
Critical path
Ahmed's scaffold (3 Nov) → Abdelrahman's guards (6 Nov) and Joudy's seed data (5 Nov)
→ Joudy's flights and Sandra's rooms (11 Nov) → Karim's holds and bookings (14 Nov, flight
holds by 11 Nov) → Ahmed's payments and refunds (16 Nov). Any slip on this chain is raised

Timeline to 20 November
Features are frozen on the evening of Tue 17 Nov, leaving two full days for bug fixing,
documentation and a rehearsed Swagger demo before the Fri 20 Nov deadline.
Daily rhythm: stand-up message by 10:00, PRs opened by evening, Ahmed reviews and

Git workflow, Definition of Done, documentation
We follow the brief's Gitflow variant exactly:
main
holds releases only,
develop
is the
integration branch, and every change arrives through a reviewed PR from a short-lived
branch.
## Rules
## Branches:
feature/<ID>-<slug>
## (e.g.
feature/FLT-22-seat-hold
## ),
fix/<ID>-
## <slug>
## ,
refactor/<slug>
## ,
docs/<slug>
; always cut from the latest
develop
## .
Keep PRs small: one requirement ID or one tightly related group, aiming for under
about 400 changed lines. Big PRs get slow reviews and cause conflicts.
Commits: Conventional Commits with the ID, e.g.
feat(flights): add round-trip
search [FLT-11]
## . Never
update
## ,
fix
or
final
## .
Branch protection: no direct pushes to
main
or
develop
; 1 approval required (Ahmed,
with the peer reviewer as second reader); squash merge; delete the branch after
merging.
Before opening a PR:
git pull --rebase origin develop
, then
npm run lint &&
npm test && npm run build
passing locally.
## Secrets:
## .env
is gitignored from the first commit;
## .env.example

## MONGODB_URI

removed no one else's code (brief 10.7).

expiry, password rules, review eligibility (Completed reservation, one per reservation),
tier selection rule, reportable types (post, comment, review, itinerary), page size 10,
upload limits, single platform currency, and the reference datasets. Still to settle:

Everyone commits from day 1 on their own
branches; the stand-up flags anyone
without a PR for 2 days
Pick the platform currency (PAY-04); USD is the safe choice for Stripe test mode
Ask the TAs whether confirming a PaymentIntent with the Stripe CLI is acceptable in
the Swagger evaluation, or whether a dev-only "test confirm" endpoint (disabled in
production) is preferred
Confirm the extra endpoints we add beyond the brief's table are fine:
## POST
## /api/auth/refresh
## ,
## /api/admin/providers/:type/:id/deactivate|reactivate
## ,
## /api/notifications
## ,
## /api/currencies
## ,
## /api/reports
## ,
## /api/admin/content/:type/:id/hide
, the refund-quote endpoints
The brief cites ACC-03 and BLG-11, which do not exist in the workbook; HTL-09 has no
endpoint in the brief and is served by
PUT /api/hotels/:id/policies
. Map them in
the traceability file
Should the activity cost (ITN-10) carry its own currency? We assume yes, so ITN-18
conversion stays consistent
