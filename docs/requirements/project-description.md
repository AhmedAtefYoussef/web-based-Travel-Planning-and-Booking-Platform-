## Software Project I, Winter 2026
Travel Planning and Booking Platform
## Project Description
## 1  Project Overview
The goal of this project is to design and implement a complete web-based Travel Planning and
Booking Platform that integrates flight booking, hotel booking, itinerary planning, budgeting, and
travel-content sharing into one coherent system.
The platform serves multiple types of users. Travelers can search for flights and hotels, make and manage
bookings, construct day-by-day itineraries, calculate trip budgets, publish itineraries, and share travel
experiences through blog posts.
Airline and hotel moderators manage the inventory and policies of their assigned providers, while admi-
nistrators supervise accounts, moderators, bookings, and community content.
The final application must demonstrate a well-designed data model, role-based authorization, ownership
restrictions, consistent booking and availability information, and integration between the backend and
frontend.
1.1  Technology Stack and MVC Architecture
The project must follow the Model–View–Controller (MVC) architectural pattern using the following
technologies:
- Model – MongoDB Atlas and NestJS: MongoDB Atlas stores the application data. NestJS sche-
mas/models represent domain entities, while services implement business logic, validation, and database
operations.
- View – Next.js: Next.js (React and TypeScript) provides the frontend interface, including public
pages, booking workflows, itinerary editors, and role-specific dashboards.
- Controller – NestJS: NestJS controllers receive HTTP requests, validate incoming data through the
application’s validation mechanisms, invoke the appropriate services, and return REST API responses.
The application consists of one NestJS backend, one Next.js frontend, and one shared MongoDB
Atlas database.
Backend functionality must be organized into feature-based modules, such as Authentication, Flights,
Hotels, Payments, Itineraries, Blog, and Administration.
## 1

2  Official Requirements and User Stories
The detailed functional requirements, user stories, and acceptance criteria are provided in the official
Excel requirements sheet.
The Excel sheet is considered an integral and authoritative part of this project description.
Project Requirements and User Stories
Each requirement has a unique identifier, such as ACC-01, FLT-11, HTL-16, PAY-01, ITN-21, and BLG-01.
These identifiers should be referenced in relevant GitHub issues, pull requests, commit messages, and
API documentation to maintain traceability.
The official workbook distinguishes between mandatory requirements and optional bonus requi-
rements.
Teams must prioritize mandatory requirements. Optional features must not replace required functionality.
## 3  Project Objectives
By completing this project, students should demonstrate their ability to:
- analyze requirements and translate them into an MVC-based full-stack application;
- design appropriate MongoDB schemas and model relationships between domain entities;
- design and implement RESTful APIs using NestJS;
- implement authentication, authorization, ownership checks, and role-based access control;
- implement searching, filtering, sorting, pagination, and server-side validation;
- handle booking availability, inventory holds, and concurrency-sensitive operations;
- implement provider policies, payments, cancellations, and refunds;
- integrate booking functionality with itinerary planning and budgeting;
- develop responsive frontend interfaces using Next.js;
- implement community and moderation functionality;
- collaborate using a professional Git/GitHub workflow.
4  System Actors and Roles
ActorRole and Responsibilities
GuestAn unauthenticated visitor who may search flights and hotels, inspect available
options, and browse public blog posts and itineraries. Restricted actions require
authentication.
Registered UserA traveler who manages a profile, books flights and hotels, manages bookings,
creates itineraries and budgets, publishes or clones public itineraries, creates
blog posts, comments, likes, submits eligible hotel reviews, and reports inappro-
priate content.
AdministratorManages platform accounts, creates moderator accounts, suspends/reactivates
users and moderators, inspects bookings, handles reports, moderates content,
and reviews audit logs.
Airline ModeratorManages exactly one assigned airline, including its profile, flights, cabin inven-
tory, prices, baggage rules, cancellation policies, and booking information.
Hotel ModeratorManages exactly one assigned hotel, including its profile, rooms, availability,
prices, policies, and reservations.
## System / Automated
## Services
Handles payment confirmation, inventory-hold expiry, notifications, exchange-
rate retrieval, booking-state updates, and audit logging.
## 5  Core Domain Entities
Students must design suitable MongoDB schemas and correctly represent relationships between entities.
## 2

Embedded documents may be used for bounded, parent-owned data, while references may be used for
shared or independently changing data.
The following table summarizes the main domain entities. Students may introduce additional supporting
entities when technically justified.
DomainEntities and Relationships
Accounts and RolesUser Account, Moderator Assignment. Users store authentication cre-
dentials, profile information, roles, preferences, and account status. Modera-
tor assignments restrict management to one provider.
FlightsAirline, Airport, Flight, Cabin Inventory, Airline Policy. Each flight
belongs to an airline, references departure and arrival airports, and contains
cabin capacity, pricing, status, and applicable policies.
Flight BookingsFlight Booking, Passenger. Bookings belong to users and contain selec-
ted flights, passengers, baggage, agreed prices, booking references, payment
information, and booking states.
HotelsHotel, Room, Room Availability, Hotel Policy. Hotels contain indivi-
dually bookable rooms with occupancy, pricing, availability, blocked dates,
and provider policies.
Hotel BookingsHotel Booking, Review. Reservations belong to users, reference selected
rooms and stay dates, and record booking/payment states. Eligible comple-
ted reservations may receive reviews.
PaymentsPayment, Refund. Payment and refund records reference bookings and
store amounts, transaction identifiers, states, timestamps, and applicable
policy information.
ItinerariesItinerary, Itinerary Day, Activity, Budget Entry, Transport Cost,
Exchange Rate. Itineraries contain ordered days, cities, activities, budget
information, and transport costs. Public clones preserve attribution.
CommunityBlog Post, Comment, Like, Tag. Posts belong to authors and support
draft/published states, comments, likes, searchable tags, and media.
5.1  Reference Data and Database Seeding
To ensure consistency across all teams, all teams must initialize their MongoDB database using the
provided reference datasets for countries, cities, airports, and attractions.
The reference datasets are available at:
## Official Reference Datasets
Important: The provided datasets will be used during the final project evaluation. Therefore, all teams
must ensure that their application supports the same reference records and identifiers.
## 6  Functional Scope
This section summarizes the main functionality. The official requirements sheet defines the exact business
rules, limits, and acceptance criteria.
6.1  Accounts and Administration
The system must support user registration, authentication, logout, password changes, profile management,
and account deactivation according to the requirements.
Account email addresses must be unique. Authentication must enforce the required password rules, failed-
login lockout, session expiry, and account status.
Role-based authorization is mandatory. Users must not access another user’s private bookings or itinera-
ries.
Airline and hotel moderators may manage only their assigned provider.
## 3

Administrators create moderator accounts, manage account status, inspect platform bookings, and mo-
derate reported content.
Administrator accounts must be seeded; administrator self-registration is not permitted.
Admin-assisted password reset is mandatory. Email verification and email-based forgotten-password re-
covery are optional bonus features.
## 6.2  Flights
Airline moderators manage airline profiles, flights, cabin categories, prices, baggage allowances, extra-
baggage rules, cancellation policies, schedule modifications, and flight cancellations.
Guests and registered users can search for one-way and round-trip flights by route, travel dates, passenger
types/counts, and cabin class.
Search results must support the required filtering and sorting options.
Registered users enter passenger and baggage details, review the booking summary, accept applicable
policies, and proceed to payment.
Flight inventory must be protected through concurrency-safe temporary holds. Holds expire after
the period specified in the requirements sheet, releasing unused inventory.
After successful payment verification, the booking becomes confirmed and receives a unique reference and
e-ticket.
Users can inspect their bookings and cancel eligible reservations according to airline policies.
Flight booking changes and seat selection are optional bonuses.
## 6.3  Hotels
Hotel moderators manage hotel profiles, individually bookable rooms, availability, pricing, blocked dates,
check-in/check-out times, cancellation policies, and reservations.
Guests and registered users search hotels by destination, dates, and guest count, with filtering and sorting.
Registered users can inspect available rooms, select one or more rooms in the same hotel, review the total
price and policies, and proceed to payment.
The backend must protect room inventory against concurrent reservations and overlapping bookings.
When multiple rooms are selected, the reservation must be handled consistently as one operation.
Users can inspect and cancel eligible reservations.
After a completed stay, users may submit reviews according to the eligibility rules in the requirements
sheet.
Hotel moderator replies to reviews are optional bonuses.
6.4  Payments and Refunds
Flight and hotel payments must use Stripe test mode.
The backend must verify payment outcomes before confirming bookings.
Provider policies must be displayed and accepted before payment, and acceptance must be recorded.
Failed or expired payments must leave bookings unconfirmed and release inventory when required.
Cancellation and refund calculations must follow the policy applicable to the booking.
Users must be able to inspect payment and refund status.
The application must not store raw card information.
6.5  Itinerary Planning and Budgeting
Registered users create itineraries containing titles, countries, start dates, ordered days, cities, activities,
images, and budget entries.
## 4

Itinerary dates are derived from the start date and the order of days.
Adding, deleting, or reordering days must update day numbering, dates, city grouping, and budget cal-
culations consistently.
Budget entries cover food, accommodation, local transportation, and activities, with separate intercity
transportation costs.
Budget totals must support currency conversion using exchange rates retrieved from FXRatesAPI.
Students must integrate FXRatesAPI through the NestJS backend to retrieve exchange rates and convert
itinerary budget amounts into the user’s selected display currency.
The system must handle invalid currency codes, unavailable exchange rates, and API request failures.
API credentials, if required, must be stored securely and must not be exposed to the frontend.
Itineraries may be public or private. Private itineraries are accessible only to their owners.
Public itineraries can be searched and viewed by others. A registered user may clone a public itinerary
into an independent private copy that preserves attribution.
Flight and hotel searches must be reusable from the itinerary context where required.
Attaching confirmed bookings to itineraries and exporting itineraries as PDF are optional bonuses.
6.6  Blog and Community
Registered users can create blog posts in Draft or Published status.
Published posts are publicly accessible and support searching, tags, author pages, comments, and likes.
Authors may edit or delete their own posts. Users may manage their own comments.
A user may like a particular post at most once.
Users may report supported content. Administrators review reports and may dismiss them, hide content,
or delete inappropriate content.
Important moderation actions must be auditable.
## 6.7  Shared System Behavior
The platform must implement:
- server-side validation and consistent error responses;
- filtering, sorting, and pagination;
- appropriate image-upload validation;
- mandatory in-app notifications;
- administrative audit logging;
- correct handling of airport time zones;
- confirmation before destructive actions;
- meaningful loading, error, and empty states.
Email notifications are optional bonuses.
## 7  Development Milestones
The project is divided into two major milestones. Each milestone must produce a demonstrable,
reviewable version of the application.
7.1  Milestone 1: Backend & API - Deadline ( 20/11)
Milestone 1 focuses on the NestJS backend and MongoDB data layer.
By the end of this milestone, teams must:
- design and implement MongoDB schemas;
- organize backend functionality into NestJS modules, controllers, services, and models;
## 5

- implement authentication and authorization;
- implement the required REST API;
- enforce booking and inventory consistency;
- implement payment, cancellation, and refund business logic;
- implement itinerary, blog, and moderation logic;
- provide server-side validation and error handling;
- document and demonstrate APIs through Swagger UI.
A frontend is not required for Milestone 1.
## 7.2  Milestone 2: Frontend & Integration - Deadline ( 11/12)
Milestone 2 focuses on implementing the Next.js frontend and integrating it with the completed ba-
ckend.
The frontend must provide:
- responsive public and authenticated pages;
- registration, login, and profile management;
- flight and hotel search and booking workflows;
- payment and cancellation interfaces;
- itinerary creation, editing, budgeting, and sharing;
- blog and community interfaces;
- airline and hotel moderator dashboards;
- administrator management and moderation interfaces;
- appropriate loading, error, and confirmation states.
Frontend validation and route protection must not replace backend validation and authori-
zation.
## 7.3  Optional Cloud Deployment Bonus
Deploying the complete application to any cloud-based platform is considered an optional bonus.
To qualify for this bonus, students must deploy both the frontend and backend and ensure that the
application is fully functional in the deployed environment.
Important: Teams applying for this bonus will be evaluated exclusively on the deployed version of
their application. The locally running version will not be considered when evaluating the deployment
bonus.

## 8.10  Supporting Services
The backend must also implement the required operations for content reporting, media uploads, notifi-
cations, exchange-rate retrieval, and administrative audit records.
These services may expose additional REST endpoints as needed to satisfy the official requirements.
8.11  MongoDB Setup
Each team must use a shared MongoDB Atlas database.
The team leader is responsible for creating and configuring the database and securely providing the
connection string to the rest of the team.
Each team member must store the connection string in a local .env file:
MONGODB_URI=<team-mongodb-atlas-connection-string>
All team members must connect their local NestJS backend to the same shared database.
The .env file must be added to .gitignore.
Teams should include an .env.example documenting required environment variable names without ex-
posing credentials.
## 9  Next.js Rendering Requirements
Students are expected to understand that different pages have different rendering requirements.
The entire application should not use a single rendering strategy.
The following table provides recommended approaches.
Page / FeatureSuggested Strategy
Published Blog PostISR / Static Rendering
Blog Listing / SearchDynamic SSR
Public Author PageISR / Static Rendering
Blog Editor / DraftsDynamic SSR + Client Components
Likes and CommentsClient Components
Public Itinerary DetailISR / Static Rendering
Public Itinerary SearchDynamic SSR
Private Itinerary DetailDynamic SSR
Itinerary EditorDynamic SSR + Client Components
User Booking PagesDynamic SSR
Flight / Hotel SearchDynamic SSR
Admin / Moderator DashboardsDynamic SSR
Students must justify their rendering decisions during evaluation.
In the Next.js App Router, Client Components should be introduced where browser-side interactivity is
required.
Public pages should include appropriate metadata for SEO where applicable.
## 10

10  Git and GitHub Development Workflow
All teams must use GitHub throughout development.
Uploading the entire project only at the end of the semester is not acceptable.
## 10.1  Repository Structure
A recommended repository structure is:
project-root/
## |
|-- backend/
|-- frontend/
|-- docs/
|   |-- requirements/
|   ‘-- api/
## |
|-- AI_PROMPTS.txt
|-- README.md
## |-- .env.example
## |-- .gitignore
## ‘-- ...
## 10.2  Main Branches
The repository should contain two long-lived branches:
- main: stable milestone/release versions.
- develop: integration branch for completed work.
Students must not develop features directly on main.
## 10.3  Feature Branches
New work must be implemented on short-lived branches created from the latest develop branch.
Recommended conventions include:
feature/<requirement-id>-<description>
fix/<requirement-id>-<description>
refactor/<description>
docs/<description>
## Examples:
feature/ACC-01-user-registration
feature/FLT-11-flight-search
feature/HTL-16-hotel-booking
fix/FLT-22-seat-hold-race-condition
Each feature branch should contain a coherent unit of work.
## 10.4  Typical Development Flow
For a new feature:
## 11

git checkout develop
git pull origin develop
git checkout -b feature/FLT-11-flight-search
# Implement the feature
git add .
git commit -m "feat(flights): implement search"
git push -u origin feature/FLT-11-flight-search
The student then opens a pull request:
feature/FLT-11-flight-search ---> develop
After review and approval, the feature is merged.
At milestone release:
develop ---> main
## 10.5  Pull Request Regulations
Each pull request should:
- have a meaningful title and description;
- reference relevant requirement IDs;
- contain only related changes;
- avoid committing secrets or environment files;
- be reviewed by the team leader;
- resolve important review comments before merging.
## 10.6  Commit Message Convention
Students should use meaningful commit messages. Conventional Commit style is recommended:
feat(auth): implement registration
feat(flights): add round-trip search
fix(hotels): prevent double booking
refactor(payments): simplify refund logic
docs(api): document booking endpoints
Avoid vague messages such as:
update
changes
final
fix
10.7  Merge Conflicts and Collaboration
Students must regularly synchronize their branches with develop.
Merge conflicts must be resolved carefully. The team leader is responsible for verifying that conflict
resolution does not remove another team member’s work.
Git history must demonstrate meaningful contributions throughout the project.
## 12
